    "\n",
    "The [BPTTIterator](https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#bpttiterator) is a custom torchtext iterator for language modeling using RNNs.  Suppose the text in an example is \"the quick brown fox\".  The target in the transducer-based RNN language model would then be \"quick brown fox jumps\".  This allows every prefix of the text to be used as an training example, with the corresponding word in the target text as the target word.  So the above would lead to four examples, written as text sequence -> target word:\n",
    "* \"the\" -> \"quick\"\n",

To illustrate let the original data be one long seqence $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_N$, in which, say, $N = 4,000$.  Further let each batch consist of $4$ examples, each of length 8.  Then the first batch created by BPTTIterator would be the following 4 examples---\n",
